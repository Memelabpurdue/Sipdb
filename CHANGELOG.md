- Substrate-specific analysis capabilities
- Parallel processing with configurable core usage
- Comprehensive quality control and validation

#### Database System
- Normalized SQLite database structure
- Automatic FASTA file generation from ASV sequences
- BLAST database creation for sequence searches
- Optimized indexing for fast queries
- Multiple pre-built views for common queries
- Support for consensus incorporator data
- Study deduplication and relationship tracking
- Sequence metrics (length, GC content)

#### Analysis Features
- Biologically-informed density thresholds (Neufeld et al. 2007, Lueders et al. 2004)
- Adaptive parameter selection based on data quality
- Smart method selection (ALDEx2 only when beneficial)
- Robust error handling with fallback options
- Quality-based study type detection
- Cached taxonomy for improved performance

#### Output and Reporting
- Excel workbooks with multiple sheets
- CSV files for all major results
- Comprehensive text summaries
- Publication-quality plots (volcano, heatmaps, QC)

- Density range: 1.650-1.800 g/ml
- Window width: 0.020 g/ml
- Window overlap: 0.010 g/ml (50%)
- Log2FC threshold: 1.0 (2-fold change)
- Adjusted p-value: 0.05

#### Performance

## How to Update

### From Pre-1.0 Versions

If you were using development versions:

```r
# Remove old versions
rm(list = ls())

# Clear cache
if (exists(".sip_taxonomy_cache")) {
  rm(.sip_taxonomy_cache, envir = .GlobalEnv)
}

# Source new version
source("sip_pipeline_v1.0.R")
source("database_builder_v1.0.R")
```

### Future Updates

```bash
# Pull latest version
git pull origin main

# Check for new dependencies
source("check_installation.R")

# Update R packages if needed
BiocManager::install(update = TRUE, ask = FALSE)
```

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to 1.0.0

If you have scripts using internal development versions, update function calls:

**Old (pre-1.0):**
```r
run_sip_analysis(...)
build_database(...)
```

**New (1.0.0):**
```r
run_complete_sip_analysis(...)
build_optimized_sip_database_v7(...)
```
